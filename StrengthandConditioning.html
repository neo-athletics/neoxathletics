<p>
    Strength the power output being applied to a moving load. 
    Think about it when you are lifting weights you are either moving 
    the weight or keeping it in place while your muscles are working together
    to stabilize the load. The real question is for how long will you be able to
    endure this force being applied against you. 
    The load could be a little too easy for you or a little difficult for 
    you to control. So, one must know the load they are using in order to
    challenge their strength. You can’t expect to get stronger if you keep it 
    at the same level.

  <h1>Warming Up</h1>

<p>
    How many of you go into the gym and start working out?
    I’m guessing many of you and how many of does people do you think
    actually warmup before the workout. pretty sue not a lot. 
    Don’t overlook on warming before working out it might help on the long run.
    There are a couple of different stretches you can do. You can start with
    an active warn or static stretch. Static stretches require you to isolate
    the muscle and lengthen it slowly. Holding the stretch for up to 30 seconds. 
    Then dynamic warm ups as the name implies will result inactions and 
    movements that will increase body temperature and increase muscle efficiency.  
    There are various ways of warming up in preparation for a heavy lift or other activity.
</p>
 <!--<div id = "more"><button id = "stretchesButton">Warm Ups</button></div> -->
</div>

<div class = "stretches ">
  <article>
    <h2>Static stretch</h2>
    <p>Holding an isolated muscle group and allowing it to lengthen it slowly and holding this position for 15-20 seconds optimal timing.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Dynamic stretch</h2>
    <p>Preparing joints for movement and muscle to activate. There will be a lot more movement in a dynamic stretch than a static.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Myofascial release</h2>
    <p>There is foam rolling and other massage tools out there that help with myofascial release. Some tools will be hyper bold and Thera gun. Which are basically high-end massage guns that allow for deep tissue massaging. </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Forms of warming up</h2>
    <p>Best advice I have received for a warm is mimic the activity you will be doing but do it with a lighter load and also base your stretch on some of the movement and muscles group that will be used during the activity. not saying to ignore other muscle groups but give better focus to those muscle that will be the primary use.</p>

  <h1>Exercises</h1>
  <p>There is more to weightlifting than just picking up a couple of pounds. 
    Have you thought about the impact your workouts have on you based on the 
    type of exercise you are doing? I am not talking about your traditional workout 
    ex. Pyramid set or strip set. No, I am talking about open chain exercises closed 
    chain exercises as well as closed circuit and so on. How about when you dumbbell press. 
    Have you thought about how different it is to do it with a barbell. Questioning 
    yourself why is it that I can bench 225 in bench press but can only do 85 lbs. in dumbbells. 
    Well my friend that is based on the type of exercise you are doing and focus on it. </p>

<article>
  <h2>Bilateral</h2>
  <p>Able to exert greater force, but compensates if muscle activation,
     flexibility or stability are not efficient. Movement is being done 
     on both sides of the body.</p>
     <ul class="exerciseList">
       <li>Squat</li>
       <li>Deadlift</li>
       <li>Barbell curl</li>
     </ul>
</article>

<article>
  <h2>Unilateral</h2>

  <p>Works limb independently. The load may decrease, 
    but it helps with range of motion works on stability.</p>

    <ul class="exerciseList">
      <li>Lunge</li>
      <li>Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift</li>
      <li>Single-arm dumbbell bench press</li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article>
  <h2>Open-chain</h2>

  <p>The hand or foot are free to move. 
    Works on single muscle group and single joint. 
    The weight is at distal placement of body.</p>

  <ul class="exerciseList">
      <li>Standing dumbbell shoulder press</li>
      <li>bench press</li>
      <li>Leg curl</li>
    </ul>

</article>

<article>
    <h2>Asymmetrical</h2>

    <p>Increases central stability, recruits’ muscles to work unison. 
      The load is carried on one side and it is likely the load will decrease.</p>
  
    <ul class="exerciseList">
        <li>Walking lunge</li>
        <li>Farmers walk with load on one side</li>
        <li>Sort of the same as unilateral except it helps in center stabilization</li>
      </ul>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>Closed-circuit</h2>

  <p>There is a greater load, but range of movement may be limited.</p>

  <ul class="exerciseList">
      <li>Standing Barbell shoulder press</li>
      <li>Used of barbell</li>
    </ul>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>Closed-chain</h2>

  <p>The hand or arm cannot move. During workout multiple joints and muscle groups are used. 
    The weight is at close proximity of the body.</p>

  <ul class="exerciseList">
      <li>Push up</li>
      <li>Pull up</li>
      <li>squats</li>

      <h1>Workouts</h1>

      <p>There are so many workouts to follow along that will help you achieve your goal 
        or whatever it is that you are training for. You just have to find the one that 
        fits your needs. What is your goal preparation for building muscle, develop strength 
        or just try to build some conditioning of an event? There are various schematics you 
        can follow. such as pyramid sets drop sets, strip sets. At the end of the day you are 
        just playing around with the weight, number of reps and sets. Let’s not forget about 
        that rest period in between sets.</p>

        <h2>Strength</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Pyramid</h3>
          <p>Helps maximize loads as progressing in sets
              The weight is incrementing as the reps lower per set.
             Usually the first two sets will be warmup sets doing around 12 reps.
             Don’t just go on doing 12 reps with a weight that you are able to rep for 20. If the idea here is to prepare your body for a heavy load while you fatigue your muscles.
             </p>
    
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Negative sets</h3>
            <p>You’ll be preparing your body for some heavy weight or maybe fatigue the muscle. 
              When I say heavy weight, I mean weight that your body finds difficult to carry, 
              maybe it can 225lbs, 315lbs or 135lbs. As long as your shocking your body with 
              some weight that is out of you 1 rep max. Doing this type of set usually requires 
              you to have as spotter for safety reasons. You’ll be seeing people do this while 
              benching because the first initiate of a bench is the eccentric (bringing down the 
              weight) part it is just you hold and resisting against the weight. 
              So, doing a negative will help your nervous system get a feel of the heavy weight 
              you are doing. Picking it right back up should be extremely difficult that is why 
              you’ll need a spotter. In case you fail to bring it back up. During this eccentric 
              part you are putting your muscles in time under tension. Spending a go od amount of 
              energy resisting the weight. So, when it comes to the concentric part it might be 
              difficult to do so.</p>

            <h3>Compound sets</h3>
            <p>when two exercises are performed at different time but finished as one repetition. 
              The end of one exercise will be the beginning position of another. For example, a 
              squat to a military press. You might want to point out that you won’t be going as 
              heavy if you were doing each exercise independently. </p>

          <h3>Super set</h3>

          <p>While doing super sets you’ll perform one exercise after another. 
            A bit different from the compound set cause your starting position is 
            not the end position of a previous exercise. Instead you’ll began the 
            exercise after resting for some time and began to the second exercise. 
            The idea of this is increase the volume of work performed in the shortest 
            amount of time. Performing antagonist muscle and protagonist.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>strip set</h3>
          
            <p>helps with improving fatigue and building muscle. The idea of this 
              type of work out is to do set after set after set with minimal rest period 
              or no rest at all. While doing a set till failure and dropping down the weight.</p>

            your traditional circuit training.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Station training</h3>
        
          <p>If you though the metabolics will be though then you have another thing coming. 
            Station training has far greater emphasis on conditioning than metabolics because 
            here you will be performing high intensity interval circuits. Such as ropes, tire 
            flipping, sledge hammer, and other activities that will help in the needs of the 
            athlete. Rest will be carried depending on activities and rounds. Time to start 
            conditioning those muscles.</p>
      </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Metabolics</h3>
          
            <p>A bit different from your tri set cause with metabolics you will performing three 
              different workouts. They can weight lifting workouts or activities that help with 
              conditioning. With no rest period in between sets. You can add some weight during 
              this training if doing it for plyometrics, but the weight will have to be 10% of the 
              athletes’ body weight. This will help the athlete train at a more reasonable manner 
              rather than having so much load on them. Leading to slower movements, compensate for 
              weakness and reduce the effectiveness of improving performance.</p>
