      <h1>Sport Nutrition</h1>

      <p>Nutrition plays an important role in the post, intra, and pre-of your workout, 
        even on your days off you must be aware of what to consume. The food we eat is 
        composed of three macro nutrients protein, carbs and fats. Each playing an essential 
        role in the human body. Like the saying goes you are what you eat. That is why we must 
        aware of what we eat on a daily basis. Then aside from those macronutrients we have 
        our micronutrients. Which are composed of vitamins minerals and trace minerals. 
        We will discuss the essential role these nutrients have in our body as well as 
        inside and outside of training.</p>
  </div>

<section>
  <h2>Macro Nutrients</h2>



  <article>
    <div class="left">
        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>

        <p>Carbohydrates the main energy source for the human body. Its importance has 
          been deteriorating in the past recent years cause new trendy diets/lifestyle. 
          But do we really understand the important role this macro nutrient has on the body. 
          Also, the importance of carbohydrates to an athlete. First of let’s talk about 
          carbohydrates in general what purpose do they serve in the human body and what 
          is it composed of. We obtain the majority of our carbohydrates from plants. 
          Such as vegetable and fruits.  So, there are different kind of carbohydrates, 
          we have our sugars, starches, and fibrous foods. For some people when they hear 
          sugar, they hear danger., but that isn’t always the case. Not all sugars are bad 
          for you. Let’s say fruit it has sugar and it is called fructose. But isn’t fruit 
          good for you at least that’s what you been told right. So why will you think all 
          of a sudden sugar is bad for you then?  Maybe in large amounts it may be, but do 
          you really know how many grams of carbohydrates should you be consuming? Well that 
          is all based on your activity level. You shouldn’t expect to be okay consuming large 
          amounts of carbohydrates and expect not to gain weight, at the end of the we eat to 
          fuel our body, but if we give our body more than it can use than guess where that 
          unused energy is going. Well one thing for sure it is not going to disappear. 
          It will go into a conversion of being stored into fat, because the body had no use for it.
        </p>
    </div>   

<div class="right">

             <p> Different types of Carbohydrates</p>

             <div class="carbs">
                <div class="simple">

              <h4>Simple carbohydrates</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>potatoes</li>
                <li>fruits</li>
                <li>white rice</li>
              </ul>
  
              <p>These are know as Fast acting carbs</p> 

              <p class = "question">When is the optimal time to take it?</p>
              <p class = "answer"> For performance take in fast acting carbohydrates 30 minutes before and if the workout is longer than
              1 hour 30 mins take in 60 more grams. For recovery take in carbohydrates as well.
              The amount you take in is based on your goal.
              </p>

              <p class = "question">Sources of this macro nutrient?</p>
              <p class = "answer">Fruits and vegetables. E.g. Bananas, corn and cane sugar</p> 
              
            </div>

            <div class="complex">
                            
              <h4>Complex carbohydrates.</h4>
             <ul>
               <li>Quinoa</li>
               <li>brown rice</li>
               <li>legumes</li>
               <li>sweet potatoes</li>
             </ul>
              <p>These are known as Slow digesting carbs</p>
              

            <p>
              The majority of these slow acting carbs contain fiber
              Fiber is non-digestible but helps in other physiological aspects of the body.
              Also helps break down food and some could be soluble and insoluble.
              Meaning one that is dissolve in water(soluble) and the other which resistant to water it doesn’t not absorb or dissolve in water.
              Fiber isn’t used as an energy source for the body there for they do not count towards the calculations of calories.

    <h3>Fats</h3>

<p>Lipids also known as fats, the one thing some of us hope to have less of in our bodies. 
  Has its role in the performance of an athlete? Yes of course who would have though that fats 
  help out, but they do. Believe it or not these fats help protect our organs against trauma. 
  So, fat has its role in the human body. But those that mean we should shove fat all over our 
  face. No, we still have to know how much and what type of fats we should be intaking. 
  Just like carbohydrates. There are different types of fats. Which will be covered later on.
   Just know that some fats are able to be used as a source of energy for the human body during
    prolong exercise. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

       <p> Different types of fat</p>

       <ul>
         <li>Polyunsaturated fat (good fat)</li>
         <li>Monounsaturated fat (good fat)</li>
         <li>saturated fat (bad fat)</li>
         <li>trans fat (bad fat)</li>
       </ul>

        <p class = "question">When is the optimal time to take it?</p>
        <p class = "answer">Try to take fat around your day keep them light during the time you are going to work out.</p>
    
        <p class = "question">Sources of this macro nutrient?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> E.g. peanuts, salmon, and coconut oil.</p>

        <p>In moderation both mono and poly improves HDL (good cholesterol) and reduce risk of heart disease
            Trans fat (bad fat)-stay away from it.
            Saturated fat (bad fat)- keep at a minimal
        </p>
    
        <p>1 gram of fat = 9 kcal.</p>
</div>

  <article>
<div class="left">
    <h3>Protein</h3>

    <p>The most overrated macro nutrient of them all Protein. Protein this protein that. 
      Well do you really know how much protein is needed based on your activity level. 
      Some of us over do it with the protein. We either consume too much of it or not enough. 
      Protein is used to help in muscle recovery. There are different forms of protein. 
      There are fast acting proteins and slow digesting ones. No, I’m not just talking about 
      your traditional whey isolate and casein protein. I am referring to foods that provide 
      you with protein and have various speeds of absorption of protein. Like milk and Greek yogurt. 
      They both are slow digesting proteins, but milk is partially fast acting protein around 20%. 
      Some fasting food source protein will be eggs.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">

    <p>Different types of protein.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Whey (fast digesting)</li>
      <li> Casein(slow digested)</li>
      <li>And those from food sources</li>
        <ul class = "nested">
        <li> Eggs</li>
        <li> Milk (20%whey 80% casein)</li>
        <li>Meat(usually steak will be slower digesting protein than Greek yogurt)</li>
        <li> Soy</li>
        <li>Peas</li>
      </ul>

    <p class = "question">When is the optimal time to take it?</p>
    <p class="answer">During the day and after your workout.</p>

    <p class = "question">Sources of this macro nutrient?</p>

    <h2>Supplements</h2>

  <p>Now let’s get to the point supplements are not meant to replace food. 
    They are there to help you out with any shortage of nutrition you are not 
    able to get through your diet. Not saying you should avoid supplements at 
    all cost but just trying help you get your moneys worth.  Cause there will 
    be times when supplementation is a lot more convenient. Such as getting creatine 
    of your whole foods. Yeah you can get it from various meats such as fish and steak 
    but how much of it will you have to eat in order to get 5 grams of creatine. 
    Well you’ll have to eat about a pound of red meat or if not a pound of fish 
    just to get 5 grams. Now what sounds more convenient shoving meat in your mouth 
    or just popping a pill or two? There will be times when to go and get some supplements 
    and there are tis when sticking with your whole foods is a better choice. Of course, 
    we can have the perfect diet getting all of our nutrition from it, but we try and whatever 
    we can’t get through our diet we use supplements.
  </p>

<div class="right">
  <dl>
  <dt>Vitamins</dt> 
    <dd>insufficient nutrients from diet supplement yourself with vitamins.</dd>  
  <dt>Protein</dt> 
    <dd>helps in muscle recovery, workout days take it after workout, nonwork out days use it as a meal replacement followed worth other condiments for a fulfilling meal.</dd> 
  <dt>Whey</dt> 
    <dd>concentrate(slow-acting), whey isolate(fast-acting), whey hydrolysates (greatest absorption).</dd> 
  <dt>Creatine</dt> 
    <dd>ATP restoration in other words energy for the muscles. You know how you were doing 5 reps with that one weight? well watch you get a good 7 or 8 reps now.</dd> 
  <dt>Fish Oil</dt> 
    <dd> delivers healthy omega 3 fatty acids which helps in hearth health, eye and brain.</dd>
  <dt>Nitric Oxide</dt> 
    <dd>delivers oxygen to the muscle and greater blood circulation.</dd> 
  <dt>Testosterone Booster</dt> 
    <dd>As men age their Testosterone levels start to decrease that is when they find themselves in a vitamin store looking for something to restore their performance in the gym and in the bedroom. Usually around the age of 30 your t levels decrease by 1%. You can slow the process down with resistance training and healthy diet.</dd>

  <h2>Nutrition and training</h2>

  <p>So, this is where it all plays out. How well do you perform based on your nutrition? 
    Did you eat enough or decided to work out fasted cause performance doesn’t matter to you. 
    You’re just trying to cut down those few extra pounds as quickly as possible. Sometimes 
    you can even over it or eat the wrong things before a workout and start getting stomach cramps. 
    What about training itself is it possible to over train and not give your body the proper rest 
    needed. What ever happen to no pain no gain.  We all have our limits and should listen to our 
    bodies when needed to do so. Glycogen is the storage form of energy in both humans and animals. 
    It is stored in the liver about 80 to 100 g and in skeletal muscles around 300 to 900 g. 
    This is where glycogen and the performance of an athlete come into play. Glycogen is the form of 
    energy the human body uses to help it go through a workout or a job such as construction that requires 
    tremendous effort to pull through it.  Surely that weight you are picking up isn’t just coming from those 
    muscles or strength that you have. It comes for the fuel that thrives your body to reach greater heights. 
    Being provided with the proper nutrition needed to do so. Your glycogen can be depleted if it is not restored. 
    So, if you have used stored glycogens stores. The go ahead and replenish them. A quick consumption of a 
    good old juice will do the trick. You must also remember that glucose the form of carbohydrate is 
    used to help the brain functions. so, if you aren’t consuming any carbohydrates for long period of time. 
    Then best believe your concentrations levels are going to be at its lowest, Affecting your performance and mental skills.

      <h3>Working out fasted</h3>

      <p>Pros
          Burns fat
          Cons
          Performance may go down
          Suitable for those training low to moderate intensity
          
          Carbohydrate intake during workout
          Helps in prolonged training and restores glycogen levels
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Over training</h3>

      <p>Yes, it does happen even to the best and to those who don’t give their body the proper recovery and nutrition it needs.
          Before over training there is over reaching. If you don’t take care of those signs as you get close to overreaching, then you might be over training and making it difficult for your body to recover. Prolonging recovery time.
          When comes to recover your body usually those it in a couple of days right no big deal, but if it ends up taking longer than awe or so then you might be overreaching our training. There for taking weeks too recover. Overcome this by giving your body proper nutrition and recovery time. Before entering over training then it might take you months instead of weeks to recover.
      </p>

      <p>Some symptoms of overreaching and overtraining.
          If there is no drop-in performance than there is no over training or over reaching.
          If so then move along to the list
          Decrease in training capacity
          decrease in appetite
          Pain in muscle and joints
          Increased incidence of injuries.

<h2>Body composition</h2>

<p>Now let’s talk about muscle mass to fat ratio and other body measurements that are used to 
  calculate body fat percentage and overall your health based on your height, age and weight. 
  There are a couple of devices out there to calculate your body fat 
  percentage and your muscle mass as well as other information. So, there is electrical 
  impedance pretty sure some of you are familiar with it. It’s a small device where you 
  hold it with hands and it sends electrical impedances through your body allowing to 
  distribute the current through you muscle and estimate total body water. Which can be 
  used to estimate fat free body mass with the difference of body weight and body fat. 
  That’s one way to get an estimate of your body fat percentage. There are several more 
  ways to identify your body fat percentage all with advantages and disadvantages.

  <h2>Weight management</h2>

  <p>How many times do you hear people say I don’t get fat cause I have a fast 
    metabolism? Do they really have a high metabolism? maybe they are only eating 
    a meal or two a day and those two meals may be big ones but at the end of the 
    day they end up meeting their caloric needs just at equilibrium. Meaning they 
    won’t gain or lose weight. Heck they might even be eating less than they expect. 
    Then the same goes to those saying they don’t eat much but the two meals they 
    eat can contain a good 1500 calories each and there for probably have them a surplus. 
    You can be eating little but if those foods are high in calories than there is no 
    point in trying to starve yourself if you are going to get those calories right 
    back in your body in a couple of hours and even go overboard. So that brings us 
    back to the idea of eating too much of something good such as the fruit may not 
    be always good for you if you don’t put it to good use. So that is why I always 
    say eat for what you are going to do next. Well at least prepare your body for 
    any intense workout or strenuous activity by providing it the fuel it needs. 
    Like somethings in life you need balance. </p>

  <p>What happens if you take too much of it? when is it too much?
        When the body has more than enough energy to use the excess amount will be stored as fat. When it is too much you are most likely at a surplus. So, if you are looking to gain weight that may be a goal you may look in to.
  </p>

  <p>To gain weight be at a surplus to lose weight be at deficit and to maintain weight be at equilibrium.</p>

  <p> 
    1 pound is equal to 3500 kcal a week. 
    Ex. Gain a pound by consuming 3500kcal more per week. 
    Spread those 3500kcal for 7 days and you’ll get 500 kcal. 
    Get 500kcal above your maintenance per day for 7 days in order to gain a pound of fat.
    To lose a pound you’ll be consuming 3500 less per week. 
    So, spread that out through 7 days and you’ll be cutting 500 kcal per day to lose a pound of fat.
    Safe to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week.

  <h3>Common methods to reach weight loss</h3>

<p>Fasting- going prolong hours without eating</p>
<p>Energy restrictions-having low-calorie diets. Giving your body less calories than it needs, making your body look out for some other source as energy either stored fat our muscle.</p>
<p>low carbohydrates-consuming less carbohydrates in you diet preventing insulin from spiking from simple sugars or having too much glucose in the blood stream.</p>
<p>Increase physical activity- you can always burn more calories by doing some sort of sport or a walk at the park if you don’t want to hit up the gym.</p>

<p>Resting metabolic rate (RMR)- the rate in which your body burns energy when it is at complete rest.</p>

<p>Energy expenditure-the amount of energy your body needs to carry out your daily activities and to keep all those functions of your body running properly. If your daily workout increases so should your caloric intake in order to balance out the energy input and energy needed. That will be your TDEE.</p>

<p>Decrease in RMR with weight loss-you know when you start losing weight at the beginning it is going well and as you progress you start seeing a decrease and then all of a sudden you can no longer lose as much weight you did before then you hit what most people call a plateau. That is your body becoming efficient when it comes to weight loss. Also, maybe because of a loss of muscle mass during cutting season. since more muscle mass does mean a greater RMR.</p>

  <h3>Mistakes during weight loss</h3>

<article>
  <h4>lose weight too fast</h4>
<p>how wonderful will it be if we can lose weight quickly without the downfalls. wouldn’t that be a dream come true yes it will be but sadly it doesn’t happen like. At most ties it is accompanied by water loss instead of weight and a decrease in performance. </p>
</article>

<article>
  <h4>lose weight during on season</h4>
<p>some of us make the mistake of cutting off weight during our on-season. The season where we are training intense. Now ask yourself how one can perform at its best without the proper nutrition. Yes of course motivation and dedication can take you there but what’s all that if you can’t even function properly. Then having your body get pounded and not giving it the proper nutrition makes one more prone to injuries.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <h4>not eating breakfast or lunch</h4>
<p>if you are not fasting then I don’t recommend you skipping breakfast or lunch. your body isn’t receiving enough calories already since you are probably burning some of them at the gym or cutting some calories from other meals. you are certainly not helping your body by skipping any more meals.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <h4>taking in too little carbohydrates</h4>
<p>what’s the first mistake some of us do when starting a weight loss goal. We drop carbs out of our diet drastically. We think it’s fine, but our bodies don’t. Yeah sure you may drop a couple of pounds the first week or so, but that may be mostly water weight. Then once you start depleting your body from carbs you may lose a couple of pounds then and there, but do you know what else drop? Your concentration and performance. You may even feel moody at times. Cause guess what you know those sugars you cut off yeah does are the ones that gives that spike we occasionally need. Besides the caffeine of course.</p>
